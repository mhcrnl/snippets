msys (MinGW) Makefile

This simple program and Makefile is to be used under msys (MinGW) on Windows.
It assumes MinGW is installed under C:\MinGW (/c/MinGW/ as a Unix-like path in
msys/MinGW). It appends the path to MinGW binaries and libraries (gcc &
friends) to the PATH environment variable and uses gcc from C:\MinGW\bin\gcc
(/c/MinGW/bin/gcc) to compile the hello.c program.
